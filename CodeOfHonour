We declare that the code submitted by us has been developed by us. Other than the code supplied for this course, we have not borrowed any piece of code from any source, be it the code developed by our class-mates, or code available from other students, or the code available on internet.
We are aware of the fact that if any evidence to the contrary is discovered, we will be expelled (along with the students who we have borrowed the code from) from the courses CS302 and CS306 immediately with FR grade and the matter will also be reported to the Academic DAC.
